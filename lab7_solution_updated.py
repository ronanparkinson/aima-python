    Step 1: Represent the facts as propositional variables

    We will represent the facts from the problem description using propositional variables:

        A: It's dark outside.
        B: The living room lights are on.
        C: It's cold outside.
        D: The heater is on.
        E: It's 7 pm.
        F: The temperature inside is below 18°C.

    Step 2: Construct rules in propositional logic

    The rules provided in the problem can be written in propositional logic as follows:

        If it's 7 pm, it is dark outside:
        E ⇒ A
        If it’s dark outside, the living room lights should be turned on:
        A ⇒ B
        If the temperature inside is below 18°C, it’s considered cold:
        F ⇒ C
        If the living room lights are on and it’s cold outside, the heater should be turned on:
        B ∧ C ⇒ D

    Scenario 1: Bob enters his home at 7 pm, and the temperature outside is 17°C (below 18°C).

        Given facts: E=True,F=TrueE=True,F=True
        Inference steps:
            E⇒A: Since E=True, A=True (It’s dark outside).
            A⇒B: Since A=True, B=True (Living room lights are on).
            F⇒C: Since F=True, C=True (It’s cold outside).
            B∧C⇒D: Since both B=True and C=True, D=True (The heater is on).
        Result: The heater is on. (Expected: True)

    Scenario 2: The temperature outside is 19°C (above 18°C).

        Given facts: E=True,F=False
        Inference steps:
            E⇒A: Since E=True, A=True (It’s dark outside).
            A⇒B: Since A=True, B=True (Living room lights are on).
            F⇒C: Since F=False, C=False (It’s not cold outside).
            B∧C⇒D: Since C=False, D=False (The heater is not on).
        Result: The heater is off. (Expected: False)

    #2 First-Order Logic - Smart Medical System

    Step 1: Define the knowledge base in FOL

    We will use predicates to define the facts:
        HasFever(x): x has a fever.
        HasCough(x): x has a cough.
        HasFlu(x): x has the flu.
        NeedsAntiviral(x): x needs antiviral medication.
        HasRash(x): x has a rash.
        HasItchiness(x): x has itchiness.
        HasAllergicReaction(x): x has an allergic reaction.
        NeedsAntihistamines(x): x needs antihistamines.

    Step 2: Rules in FOL

    We represent the rules from the problem description using FOL:

        If someone has a fever and a cough, they might have the flu:
        ∀x HasFever(x) ∧ HasCough(x) ⇒ HasFlu(x)
        
        If someone has the flu, they need antiviral medication:
        ∀x HasFlu(x) ⇒ NeedsAntiviral(x)
        
        If someone has a rash and itchiness, they might have an allergic reaction:
        ∀x HasRash(x) ∧ HasItchiness(x) ⇒ HasAllergicReaction(x)
        
        If someone has an allergic reaction, they need antihistamines:
        ∀x HasAllergicReaction(x) ⇒ NeedsAntihistamines(x)
        

    Step 3: Given facts

        John has a fever and a cough:
        HasFever(John),HasCough(John)
        Alice has a rash:
        HasRash(Alice)

    Step 4: Forward Chaining to Determine Treatments

    Using forward chaining, we can infer:

        For John:
        Since John has a fever and a cough, 
        HasFever(John) ∧ HasCough(John) ⇒ HasFlu(John), so John has the flu.
            Since John has the flu, 
        HasFlu(John) ⇒ NeedsAntiviral(John), so John needs antiviral medication.

        For Alice:
            Since Alice has a rash, but no information about itchiness is provided, we cannot infer if Alice has an allergic reaction, and thus we cannot determine if she needs antihistamines.

    Step 5: Results

        John's treatment: John needs antiviral medication.
        Alice's treatment: No treatment determined from the given information.
